# Effective-C-55-Ways-Note-
This is a repository for notes I took when reading the book ***Effective C++ Third Edition: 55 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs*** by Scott Meyers. The note contains of what are the important takeaways from the book. Note that this is not a redistribution of the content of the book, just some note I took for me to learn more about C++ programming language and design, and hopefully this can also help others who wish to improve their design of C++ programs.

### List of Effective C++ techniques: 
[1. View C++ as a federation of languages](https://github.com/sliu-trinity/Effective-Cpp-55-Ways-Note/blob/master/item1.md)

[2. Prefer consts, enums, and inlines to #defines.](https://github.com/sliu-trinity/Effective-Cpp-55-Ways-Note/blob/master/item2.md)
